# jenkins-installation
Jenkins installation script in linux

This script first installs the necessary dependencies, including the Java development kit and wget. It then adds the Jenkins repository to the system and imports the repository key. Finally, it installs the Jenkins package, starts the Jenkins service, and enables the Jenkins service to start automatically on boot.

Save the script with a .sh extension, and make it executable using the chmod +x command. You can then run the script with sudo ./jenkins.sh to install Jenkins on your Red Hat-based operating system.
